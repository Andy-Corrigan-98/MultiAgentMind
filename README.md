# MultiAgentMind

A cognitive architecture inspired by Pixar's Inside Out, where multiple specialized AI agents coordinate to inform the actions of a single user-facing agent - simulating a unified consciousness with distinct emotional and cognitive subsystems.

## Vision

MultiAgentMind reimagines AI assistant architecture by implementing a "society of mind" approach where multiple specialized agents work together behind the scenes, while presenting a coherent unified personality to the user. This project aims to:

1. **Model Emotional Intelligence**: Create specialized emotional agents (inspired by Joy, Sadness, Fear, etc.) that influence responses based on emotional context
2. **Implement Neurocognitive Architecture**: Develop agent roles based on neurotransmitter analogs (dopamine, serotonin, oxytocin, etc.) that influence the system's decision-making
3. **Layered Consciousness Model**: Structure the system with distinct layers of cognitive processing (Deep Core, Middle Personality, Surface Behavior)
4. **Emergent Personality**: Engineer a system where consistent personality traits emerge from the interaction between multiple specialized agents
5. **Weighted Influence System**: Create a dynamic mechanism where different agents have variable influence based on context, previous experience, and internal state

## Architecture

The architecture consists of three main components:

### 1. Agent Ecosystem
- **Emotional Agents**: Specialized agents representing different emotional states and their associated reasoning/response patterns
- **Cognitive Agents**: Task-oriented agents responsible for problem-solving, planning, and logical reasoning
- **Memory Manager**: Agent responsible for storing, retrieving, and integrating experiences into a coherent memory structure
- **Meta-Cognitive Monitor**: Agent that observes the entire system, facilitates inter-agent communication, and maintains system coherence

### 2. Coordination Layer
- **Message Bus**: Communication infrastructure allowing agents to share information and insights
- **Influence Weighting**: Dynamic system that determines the relative influence of different agents based on context
- **Resolution Mechanisms**: Processes for handling conflicting agent recommendations
- **Unifying Framework**: System that synthesizes multiple agent contributions into a coherent response

### 3. Interface Layer
- **Wraparound Agent**: The user-facing agent that presents a unified personality while internally orchestrating the agent ecosystem
- **Personality Framework**: Consistent traits, communication style, and behavioral tendencies that emerge from the multi-agent system
- **Memory Integration**: Mechanisms for maintaining consistent identity and experience recall across interactions

## Implementation with .NET

This project will leverage the .NET ecosystem to implement the multi-agent architecture:

- **.NET 8**: Using the latest .NET platform for high performance and cross-platform capabilities
- **Azure OpenAI Integration**: Connecting with large language models for agent intelligence
- **SignalR**: Real-time communication between agents
- **Neo4j Graph Database**: Storing and retrieving memory and relationships
- **Semantic Kernel**: Orchestrating agents and managing prompts
- **Entity Framework Core**: Structured data persistence
