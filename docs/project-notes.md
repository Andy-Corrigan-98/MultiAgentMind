# MultiAgentMind Project Notes

This document contains personal notes on the development approach for the MultiAgentMind project.

## Project Overview

MultiAgentMind is a personal research project exploring cognitive architectures for AI systems. The project is currently in early experimental stages and is being developed as a solo endeavor.

## Development Notes

### Technology Stack

The project uses:

- .NET 8.0
- C# 12
- Azure OpenAI SDK
- Neo4j for graph database
- Semantic Kernel

### Development Environment

- Visual Studio 2022 or JetBrains Rider
- Docker for containerization
- Azure for cloud services

### Code Organization

The codebase is organized into the following main areas:

- **Agents**: Agent definitions and behaviors
- **Memory**: Persistence and knowledge graph
- **Communication**: Agent communication infrastructure
- **API**: External interfaces
- **Core**: Shared utilities and base classes

### Design Principles

The implementation adheres to these principles:

1. **Clean Architecture**: Separation of concerns with distinct layers
2. **Domain-Driven Design**: Focus on the cognitive architecture domain model
3. **Interface-Based Design**: Components interact through well-defined interfaces
4. **Testability**: Components designed for easy unit testing
5. **Extensibility**: New agent types can be added without modifying core components

### Testing Approach

The testing strategy includes:

- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests for agent interactions
- Simulation tests for entire agent ecosystems
- Performance benchmarks

### Documentation Standards

Documentation includes:

- XML comments for public APIs
- Architecture diagrams
- Behavioral specifications for agents
- User guides for implementations

## Future Exploration Areas

Areas for future investigation:

- Optimization of token usage for LLM interactions
- Alternative memory structures for different use cases
- Cross-agent learning mechanisms
- Emotional intelligence modeling
- Coherent personality emergence
